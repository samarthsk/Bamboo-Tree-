# Bamboo-Tree-
Determining the cuisine of a dish based on its ingredients
•	Tools used: Jupyter Lab.
•	Language used: Python
•	Libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, Regular Expression, Random, Matplotlib, sklearn, graphviz.
•	Identified and Gathered the available data resources from IBM Server in a CSV format.
•	Created the suitable decision tree required for the machine learning algorithm.
•	Downloaded the data from the IBM server and read it into the Pandas Dataframe.
•	explored the data further and making sure that it is in the right format for the machine learning algorithm that we selected in the analytic approach stage as seen in decision trees.
•	Cleaned the data as per required.
•	Classified the recipes according to the ingredients used.
•	Created the decision tree for just some of the Asian and Indian cuisines.
•	Evaluated the model, created a new Dataframe containing 30 recipes from each cuisine randomly.
•	Now created the training set, then plotted the decision tree and explored it.
•	Then created a confusion matrix to check how well the decision tree is able to correctly classify the recipes.
